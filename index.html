        he elephant is Earth's largest land animal, although the Asian elephant is slightly smaller than its African cousin. Asian elephants can be identified by their smaller, rounded ears(An African elephant's ears resemble the continent of Africa). African elephants stand 3–4 m (10–13 ft) and weigh 4,000–7,000 kg (8,800–15,400 lb) while Asian elephants stand 2–3.5 m (7–11 ft) and weigh 3,000–5,000 kg (6,600–11,000 lb). In both cases, males are larger than females. All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects.</p>

        <p>Elephant ears radiate heat to help keep these large animals cool, but sometimes that isn't enough. Elephants are fond of water and enjoy showering by sucking water into their trunks and spraying it all over themselves.
  An elephant's trunk is actually a long nose with many functions. It is used for smelling, breathing, trumpeting, drinking, and also for grabbing things—especially a potential meal. The trunk alone contains about 100,000 different muscles. Asian elephants have a fingerlike feature on the end of their trunk that they can use to grab small items. (African elephants have two.)</p>

        or the most part humans and elephants work well together, that isn’t always the case. When we hear stories of these animals being violent we have to remember that they are wild animals. The fact that we have become used to seeing them around people doesn’t mean that as a whole they have become domesticated. The temperament of each one as well as the personality is very different.
  In many areas of the world including Asia, elephants are working animals. They are well cared for though with days off in between to help them cope. Females don’t have to work once they are pregnant and there is always plenty of food for these animals. They have the job of moving heavy logs and other items in areas where there isn’t machinery to do it.</p>
        <div class="line-break"></div>
        <p>There are some heroic stories as well of elephants stepping in to help humans. It can be to protect them from animals including other elephants at times. They have been able to help them when natural disasters occur, moving heavy items to get to people and to rescue them. Most researchers aren’t surprised by these acts at all though. This is because they elephant is well known to being intelligent and capable of experiencing the same emotions as humans.</p>

        he relationship between humans and elephants has had its ups and downs. Some people are out to destroy them, thinking that hunting of these massive animals is the ultimate thrill. Others don’t care if they are extinct but in the mean time they will slaughter elephants in order to make money from the sell of their ivory tusks.
        <div class="line-break"></div>
          <p>The invention of guns increased the pressure. The 19th century brought a fashion for big game hunting among colonialists, which wiped out herds across the continent of Africa. Now the remaining dwindling numbers face the threat of local hunters and modern poaching gangs, financed by Asian syndicates and armed by the conflicts of Africa.
  Elephants are the end of a 60m-year lineage – last of the megaherbivores.
  Some experts see the brutal killings of elephants not as a battle for a commodity, but for land. As the human population booms, so does demand for space. Poaching conveniently removes elephants from the land, leaving it open to development.</p>
